# calculator
Project: Calculator.

Algorithm:

  The user will input desired number and operator by clicking the button on the calculator in a normal math calculation order to get the desired output on the screen.

  There will be a scenario that needs to be considered:  multiplication and division have higher calculated priority than sum and difference. For example, when calculating 1+2x3, 2x3 should be calculated first.
